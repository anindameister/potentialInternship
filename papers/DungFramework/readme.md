# On the acceptability of arguments and its fundamental role in nonmonotonic reasoning, logic programming and n-person games - Phan Minh Dung

## Abstract

- The purpose of this paper is to study the fundamental mechanism, humans use in **argumentation**, and to explore ways to implement this mechanism on computers.
    - **mission argumentation introduction to computers**
        - We do so by first developing a theory for argumentation 
            - whose central notion is the acceptability of arguments.
                - Then we argue for the “correctness” 
                    - or “appropriateness” of our theory 
                        - with two strong arguments.
                            - The first one shows that most of the major approaches to nonmonotonic reasoning in AI and logic programming  are special forms of our theory of argumentation.
                                - Monotonic reasoning: **Monotonic** is the definite clause logic in which anything that could be concluded before a clause is added and still be concluded after it is added.
                                - A logic is **non-monotonic** if some conclusions can be invalidated by adding more knowledge.
